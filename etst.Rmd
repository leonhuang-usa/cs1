```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
load(file="FullData.RData")
library('plyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('dplyr')
library('tidyr')
library('reshape2')
library(knitr)
Brew <- read.csv(file="Breweries.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")  
Beers <- read.csv(file="Beers.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")  

BPS <- data.frame(table(Brew$State)) #Breweries Per State

BBeers <- rename(Beers, Brew_ID=Brewery_id, Beer_name=Name) #change headers to prepare for merge
```

##This report represents the findings pertaining to various beers and breweries in the states.
```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
BPS <- data.frame(table(Brew$State)) #Breweries Per State
kable(BPS, caption = "Breweries per State", col.names = c('State', 'Number of Breweries'))
```

##Data from various agencies was combined to produce one complete set containing all variables pertaining to breweries and beers in the states. The below table represents the first and last rows, indicating a successful merge.
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
FullData<-merge(BBeers, Brew)

First<-head(FullData, 6)
Last<-tail(FullData, 6)
FnL<-c(First, Last)
kable(First, caption = "First Rows")
kable(Last, caption = "Last Rows")
```

##With data of this size, it is inevitable that values were not reported. Below indicates the total number of missing values per variable group.
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
NAs<-colSums(is.na(FullData))
kable(NAs, caption = "Missing Values")
```

##Each state has unique alcohol contents and international bitterness units. The below table shows the median of each value per state.
```{r table2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
medians<-aggregate(FullData[, 4:5], list(FullData$State), median, na.rm=TRUE)
kable(medians, caption = "The Middle Values", col.names = c('States', 'Alcohol by Volume', 'Bitterness'))
```

```{r, fig.width=12, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

medians<-aggregate(FullData[, 4:5], list(FullData$State), median, na.rm=TRUE)
names(medians)[1] <- "State"

a<-ggplot(medians, aes(State, ABV))
b<-ggplot(medians, aes(State, IBU))
a +geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = ABV)) + ggtitle("Median Values of ABV")
b +geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = IBU)) + ggtitle("Median Values of IBU")
```

##From this data, we are able to determine which states have the most bitter and most alcohol by volume beers. Colorado has the Lee Hill Series Vol 5 - Belgian Sytle Quadrupel Ale, which contains 0.128 alcohol by volume, and Oregon has the most bitter beer, Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA.
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
maxstate<-subset(FullData, ABV == max(FullData$ABV, na.rm = TRUE) | IBU == max(FullData$IBU, na.rm = TRUE))

kable(maxstate, caption = 'Maximum ABV and IBU')

#Colorado has the maximum alcoholic beer, and Oregon has the most bitter beer.
```

##Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
```{r , echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(FullData$ABV)

```

##From this data, we were able to determine that there is a relationship between bitterness and alcohol by volume. We cannot say wether one factor is caused or causes the other, but where there is a high ABV, there is a high probablity that it will be a bitter beer.
```{r, fig.width=12, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sp <- ggplot(FullData, aes(x=ABV, y=IBU)) + geom_point()
sp + labs(title="Relationship Between Bitterness and Alcohol Content",
          x ="Alcohol by Volume", y = "International Bitterness Unit")
```
